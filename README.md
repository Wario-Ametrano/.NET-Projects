# C# .NET Projects 🇨#️⃣

A collection of C# and .NET projects showcasing different applications built with Microsoft’s .NET framework.
This repository contains various sample apps and utilities that demonstrate practical coding patterns, basic architecture, and real-world use of .NET features.

## Projects Included 📁

Each folder in this repository is a standalone .NET project. Currently included are:

- LawyerOffice – A management utility for legal firm tasks
- ListEser – A simple list handling application
- SerilogCons – Console app with logging using Serilog
- Astr.cs – (project / experiment with C# logic)
  
Tip: You can enhance the descriptions above with specific details of each project — what it does, which .NET features or libraries it demonstrates, and what you learned building it.

## Tech Stack 📦

This repository is built with:

- C# – Main programming language
- .NET (Core / Framework) – Platform for building cross-platform applications
- Serilog – Structured logging example in SerilogCons
  
.NET is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern applications, supported by Microsoft and a large community.

🧠 What You Can Learn

This collection helps you explore:

Core C# syntax and application structure

.NET project organization

Logging in .NET applications (e.g., Serilog)

Building simple console and utility applications

The goal is to provide practical examples of .NET usage that can be referenced or extended to build more complex applications.

.NET’s open-source design and tooling encourage modular code and powerful developer experiences.
